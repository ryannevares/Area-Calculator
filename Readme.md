Area Calculator

version 2.5

Python version 2.7

This is a command line based area calculator that can calculate the area for several shapes and the surface area for several solids.  This is one of my earliest python projects so it might not be the prettiest but in the future I have plans to also add features such as more shapes and solids as well as the ability to calculate volumes.  Also, I will add an exit option to the main menu.
