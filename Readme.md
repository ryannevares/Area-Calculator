Area Calculator

version 2.6

Python version 2.7

All dependencies are in the standard Python Libraries

To run, simply open your command line and type "python" and then the file name. 



This is a command line based area calculator that can calculate the area for several shapes and the surface area for several solids.  This is one of my earliest python projects so it might not be the prettiest but in the future I have plans to also add features such as more shapes and solids as well as the ability to calculate volumes.  Also, I will add an exit option to the main menu.

Please report any bugs or suggestions to ryannevares@gmail.com


CHANGELOG:

New in 2.6:
* Slow typing more widely implemented
* Slow typing speed increased
* no more camelCase variables, changed them all to snake_case
* Improved layout of text output
* Added quit option to the main menu
